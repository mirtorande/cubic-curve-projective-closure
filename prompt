Newton's classification of cubic plane curves should include 27 different types. Could you list them along with a name, brief explaination and an example formula?
I already know oval, folium, strophoid, hyperbola, parabola, ellipse, nodeless cubic, nodal cubic, cissoid, trigonal curve, pentagonal curve, nodular curve, double line, tropic curve, right strophoid, left strophoid, tell me abot the other ones.

Sure, Newton's classification of cubic plane curves includes 27 different types, also known as "cubic curves in Weierstrass form". Here is a list of the types with a name, brief explanation, and an example formula for each one:

    Oval: This type of curve consists of a single, closed loop. Its equation is of the form x^3 + y^3 = k.

    Folium: This type of curve consists of three loops that intersect at the origin. Its equation is of the form x^3 + y^3 = 3axy.

    Strophoid: This type of curve consists of a single loop that intersects the origin. Its equation is of the form x^3 + y^3 = axy.

    Hyperbola: This type of curve consists of two branches that are mirror images of each other. Its equation is of the form x^3 - y^3 = kx.

    Parabola: This type of curve consists of a single branch that is open at one end. Its equation is of the form y^2 = ax^3.

    Ellipse: This type of curve consists of a closed loop that is elongated in one direction. Its equation is of the form x^3 + y^3 = axy.

    Nodeless Cubic: This type of curve consists of a single branch that does not pass through the origin. Its equation is of the form y^2 = x(x^2 + a).

    Nodal Cubic: This type of curve consists of a single branch that passes through the origin. Its equation is of the form y^2 = x^2(x + a).

    Cissoid: This type of curve consists of two branches that intersect at the origin. Its equation is of the form x^3 + y^3 = axy^2.

    Trigonal Curve: This type of curve consists of three branches that meet at three distinct points. Its equation is of the form y^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c.

    Pentagonal Curve: This type of curve consists of five branches that meet at five distinct points. Its equation is of the form y^2 = x^5 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.

    Nodular Curve: This type of curve consists of a single loop that passes through the origin and two other points. Its equation is of the form y^2 = x^4 + ax^2 + bx + c.

    Bicuspid Curve: This type of curve consists of two branches that intersect at a single point. Its equation is

    Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are the remaining 15 types of cubic plane curves, along with their names, brief explanations, and example formulas:

    Double line: This is a curve consisting of two intersecting lines. Its equation is simply the product of two linear factors, such as (x+y)(x-y) = 0.

    Tropic curve: This is a curve formed by the intersection of two non-intersecting loops, like the shape of the numeral 8. Its equation is (x^2+y^2)^2 - 2a^2(x^2-y^2) = 0, where a is a constant.

    Right strophoid: This curve is similar to the strophoid, but with the cusp at the origin. Its equation is y^2(x-a) = x^2(x-2a), where a is a constant.

    Left strophoid: This is the mirror image of the right strophoid, with the cusp at the origin and the branches pointing in the opposite direction. Its equation is y^2(x+a) = x^2(x+2a), where a is a constant.
